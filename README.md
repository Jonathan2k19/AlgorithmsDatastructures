__Implementing common datastructures and algorithms in Java.__

+ Good reference repository: https://github.com/williamfiset/Algorithms. <br>
+ Tool for generating `.gitignore` file: https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore. However, after hours of frustration I used the `.gitignore` from williamfiset.
+ Some help for `.gitignore` problems:
