# DatastructuresAlgorithms

__THIS IS A COLLECTION OF SOME DATASTRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS IN JAVA__
+ first time using Gradle \
    -> use the `build.gradle` as a template for future gradle projects
+ I also included checkstyle support

---

## Some resources
+ Good collection of algorithms (and DS): https://cp-algorithms.com/ 
+ Good reference repository: https://github.com/williamfiset/Algorithms
+ Tool for generating `.gitignore` file: https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore. \
    -> However, after hours of frustration I used the `.gitignore` from williamfiset.
+ Some help for `.gitignore` problems:
    + https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45400361/why-is-gitignore-not-ignoring-my-files#45400404

## DATASTRUCTURES

+ [ ] Hash table with linked list
+ [ ] graph theory
    + [ ] "normal" graph with adjacency list or matrix
    + [ ] minimal spanning tree
+ [ ] other datastructures
    + [X] stack: normal stack, minimum stack
    + [ ] queue: "normal" queue, dequeue, median queue with 2 heaps, priority queue
    + [ ] linked list
    + [X] array list with stacks
+ [ ] trees
    + [ ] binary search tree
    + [ ] self-balancing (AVL)
